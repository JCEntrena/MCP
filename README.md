Maximum Clique Problem

The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is the problem of finding cliques (complete graphs) contained in a graph. 
Among the different approaches that exist, this repositori will focus exclusively on finding the largest clique in a graph. 

The objective of this study is to determine which algorithms works better on finding those cliques, and stablish a comparison between all of them.
